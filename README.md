The transmission of shares is a crucial process that investors, especially NRIs, need to understand when dealing with the transfer of ownership of shares due to events such as death or incapacity. This process allows for the transfer of ownership of shares to heirs or legal representatives without the need for a sale transaction. In this article, we will explore the concept of transmission of shares, how it works, and the various considerations for NRIs investing in Indian stock market.

What is the Transmission of Shares?
The transmission of shares refers to the transfer of ownership of shares due to the death or incapacity of the shareholder. It differs from the regular transfer of shares in that it does not involve a sale and purchase agreement but is executed through legal inheritance or assignment to a nominee. NRIs can face unique challenges when transferring shares, but it is an important process to ensure the smooth transition of assets to the rightful heir.

When a shareholder passes away, the legal representative (such as a spouse or child) or the heir may apply to the company for the transmission of shares. This process is typically initiated by submitting the relevant documents, such as a death certificate, will, and proof of relationship to the deceased. The company will then validate the documents and transfer the shares to the new owner.

How Does the Transmission of Shares Work?
Initiating the Process: The transmission of shares is typically initiated by the legal heir or representative of the deceased shareholder. They must contact the registrar of the company or the mutual funds for NRI investment platform holding the shares. The heir needs to provide the necessary documents such as the death certificate, a succession certificate, or a copy of the probate if applicable.

Submission of Documents: Along with the legal documents, the heir may also need to submit the original share certificates (if physical), the transmission request form, and identity proof. This will help the company confirm the identity of the heir and process the transmission in accordance with company regulations.

Verification Process: The company will verify the authenticity of the documents and the legitimacy of the claim. If everything is in order, the company will initiate the transmission of shares in favor of the legal heir or nominee.

Completion of Transmission: After the verification, the shares will be transferred to the name of the new shareholder, who will now have full ownership and rights over the shares. If the shares were in mutual funds for NRI, the equivalent units would be transferred to the NRI’s account.

Key Considerations for NRIs in Transmission of Shares
Taxation Considerations: PMS taxation for NRI and other tax implications related to NRI investment in share market need to be understood. Transmission of shares does not incur capital gains tax, but once the shares are transferred, any sale or transfer of shares will be subject to tax based on the market conditions and holding period. NRIs need to keep track of these taxes to manage their portfolios efficiently.

Nominee vs. Legal Heir: In the case of NRI investment in share market, it is essential to have a nominee registered for the shares. If a nominee is named, the process of transmission of shares becomes simpler as the nominee is the rightful person to inherit the shares. If there is no nominee, legal heirs must go through a more formal process, which could involve submitting additional documents and undergoing a more prolonged verification process.

Documentation for Transmission: As mentioned, proper documentation is vital for NRIs investing in mutual funds or shares in India. These documents may include the death certificate, succession certificate, will, and any other documents that may prove the relationship between the deceased and the heir. NRIs should ensure they have all the required paperwork in order to avoid delays in the transmission process.

Bank Accounts and Securities: The process of transferring shares will also require updating of the respective bank accounts and securities accounts held by the deceased person. The heir will need to apply for the transfer of any related assets such as bank accounts and securities as well.

Transmission of Shares vs. Transfer of Shares
The transmission of shares should not be confused with the transfer of shares. While transmission involves a legal transfer due to death or incapacity, a regular transfer of shares involves a voluntary sale or gift of shares by the owner to another individual. For NRIs, it is essential to understand these distinctions and ensure they are following the correct procedure for each.

What Happens if the Shares Are in Mutual Funds?
If the shares held by the deceased are in the form of mutual funds for NRI units, the transmission process is slightly different. NRIs should inform the fund manager or registrar about the death of the unit holder and submit the required documents. The mutual fund investment by NRI process for transmission may also involve filling out specific forms and undergoing a verification process similar to that of direct shares.

Alternative Investment Options for NRIs
When it comes to investment options, NRIs have several routes to explore beyond shares. Alternate investment funds (AIF) and alternative mutual funds offer diversification and different risk profiles for investors. AIF alternative investment funds are gaining popularity as they provide access to sectors such as real estate, private equity, and hedge funds that are not typically available in traditional markets. NRIs looking to diversify their portfolios can explore these options to maximize returns.

Another growing trend is investing in fixed deposits (FD) in India for NRI, where they can take advantage of NRI fixed deposit rates in India and NRI interest rates in India, which are often higher than those in other countries. For NRIs seeking a more secure, low-risk investment, FD rates in India present an excellent alternative. The highest FD rates in India offer NRIs better returns and are a great way to preserve capital.

Conclusion
The transmission of shares is an important aspect of estate planning for NRIs. It ensures that shares and other financial assets are passed on smoothly to the rightful heirs in the event of death. Understanding the process, tax implications, and necessary documentation can help avoid complications. Additionally, exploring mutual funds for NRI or AIF alternative investment funds can offer NRIs greater diversification and long-term financial stability.
